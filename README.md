# MazeSolver
A multi-class program that uses recursive algorithms to solve a maze for any start and end point inputted by the user.

## Features
* Implementation of an interface for constant characters used to construct the maze.
* Java API for reading from a text file.
* User-defined start and end point.
* Recursive algorithm to find the solution to the maze.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Compile and run the program in your Java environment.
3. Input the start and end points of the maze.
4. The program will output the solution of the maze.

## Notes
* The program assumes that the maze is constructed with a specific set of characters. These characters and their 
* associated values are defined in the interface included in the code.
* The program reads the maze from a text file. The file name should be specified in the code.
* The program outputs the solution of the maze in the console.

## Requirements
* Java SE Development Kit (JDK)
* Any Java integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.
